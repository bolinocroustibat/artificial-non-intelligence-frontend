# Artificial Non Intelligence - Frontend

Basic frontend with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no dependencies.

THIS BRANCH IS NOT USED ANYMORE, ONLY AS A REDIRECT? SINCE THE APP IS NOW HOSTED ON NETLIFY, NOT HEROKU ANYMORE


## To deploy on Heroku

Add Heroku app as origin, if necessary:
`heroku git:remote -a artificial-non-intelligence`

Deploy the `heroku` local branch to Heroku origin master branch, with:
`git push heroku heroku:master`
